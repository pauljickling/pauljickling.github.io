I know its been awhile since I updated my machine learning series. Unfortunately I am here to announce that it will still be awhile longer until I have time to update it. I have had some job interviews coming up in the near future that I have been busy preparing for, so most of my time has been spent on whiteboard topics.

I plan to write a blog post later this month covering some tips on interview prep, and then I plan to resume machine learning topics in December.
