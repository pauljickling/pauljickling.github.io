I know it has been awhile since my last update for the machine learning series. Unfortunately I am here to announce that it will be awhile longer until I have time to update it. I have some job interviews in the near future that I have been busy preparing for, and that has consumed most of my time.

I plan to write a blog post later this month covering some tips on interview prep, and then I plan to resume machine learning topics in December.
