title: "Unity Demonstrates the Importance of FOSS"

The news of Unity's proposed changes to its pricing structure is another reminder of why I'm glad I don't work in game development. But also it is another demonstration of the importance of using open-source software particularly with regard to tooling. If you are using proprietary software for tasks that are part of your livlihood, then that means that you fundamentally do not have control over your livlihood, and it can be taken away with a single updated license agreement. I am not a FOSS diehard, I get why someone would rather use Zoom instead of setting up and running their own instance of Jitsi. But at this point it is basically negligent not to factor these types of issues into your decision making process. Remember, the tech industry as it exists was built up in the post-2008 recession when interest rates in the U.S. were effectively zero, and so there was a lot of free money being thrown around. Now that interest rates are up a lot of these tech companies are facing financial pressures to turn profits that would have been overlooked in the previous era. Expect to see more companies looking for ways to extract rents from users of any proprietary tech.
