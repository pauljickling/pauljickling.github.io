Jekyll notes:

Markdown files for blog posts must be formatted this way:

YYYY-MM-DD-Title-With-Dashes.markdown

Every entry begins with this header:

---
layout: post
title:  title in quotes here
date:   YYYY-MM-DD
categories: tags separated by spaces
---

Markdown files accept HTML tags and markdown syntax. For more details see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

There is additional good documentation on markdown syntax here https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
